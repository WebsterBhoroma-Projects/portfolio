# Hi there, I'm Webster Bhoroma!
# Gap Analyzer | Solutions Architect | IT Specialist
I am a results-driven IT Specialist with an Advanced Diploma in Communication Networks from Walter Sisulu University.
I specialize in bridging the gap between complex network infrastructure and user-centric software solutions. 
I don't just write code; I build prototypes that solve real-world "technical disconnects."

# What I Do
Full Stack Development: Crafting responsive, multilingual applications that solve communication silos.
Network Engineering: Designing and managing scalable connectivity backbones.
Rapid Prototyping: Translating complex problem statements into functional technical models (as seen in my ECSA Hackathon win).

# Tech Stack
Web: WordPress, PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Networks: Communication Networks, Infrastructure Design, Hosting Management
Tools: UI/UX Design, Solution Architecture, Research-driven Development
# Featured Projects
# Syalimamthatha (Agri-Tech)
A multilingual social media application bridging the gap between commercial farmers, subsistence farmers, and the government. 
This project solved critical "information silo" problems in the Mthatha area.
I developed the prototype to showcase its importance during my advanced diploma project.

# UMP & WRC Farmer’s Network
A research-based social platform funded by the Water Research Commission. 
The success of this project secured my academic funding for postgraduate studies and demonstrated the power of tech in agriculture.

# GConnect Network Solutions
Corporate web presence and service cataloging for a professional Network Solutions Provider.

# Awards & Recognition
2nd Place – ECSA Hackathon (2023): Recognized by the Engineering Council of South Africa for rapid engineering prototyping and problem-solving under pressure.

# Impact Stats
"My WRC-funded agri-tech platform was so successful it funded my postgraduate studies. 
I build things that work in the real world."

# Let's Connect!
I am currently open to opportunities in Network Engineering, Software Development, and Solution Architecture.
